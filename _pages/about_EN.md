I was born and raised in northern Germany. Possibly my profession was somewhat pre-determined by ZX-81, Apple ][ and Amiga 500. I studied “media computer science” at FH Furtwangen (nowadays: “Hochschule Furtwangen University” ) from 1993 till 1997.

Furtwangen was one of the first Media Computer Science curricula in Germany every... a year or two, before the internet raised to public's attention, and when “Multi Media” was rarely known, and meant CD-ROMs or stamp-sized videos.

Through internshops and my diploma thesis I got to know my hometown by choice Hamburg. Initially my focus was on „computer graphics + pogramming“, video compositing (Flint/Flame/Inferno on SGI were the top end machines in those days) and some 3D animation (Softimage, 3D Studio, 3DS Max). By the end of 1999 I finally got up to long-hedged plans for a round-the-world backpacker trip...

That went nicely and according to plan, including a planned 6 wonderful weeks in Beijing, doing Flint/Flame Compositing end Video Editing at „Huayu TV Postproduction“. And continued quite spontaneously in Singpore. Where I worked as a visting lecturer at “Ngee Ann Polytechnic”, doing a combination of computer graphics and programming subjects. With full responsibilty für course contents and even exams as “module leader”.

Two years with mostly anglo saxon Flatmates, Teaching & Working on English gave me a pretty good level of English. For reasons of personal stubborness I decided to return eastbound, according to my original plan. That way, it still became a round-the-world-trip.

Right in time for my return in 2002, the internet bubble bursts, also over Germany. Not ideal for half-a-programmer, half-pixel-pusher. Since I realized, that programming can be my passion, but still missed a thing or two, I went for an “upgrade”, doing a Master's degree at Fachhochschule Wedel, right outside the gates of the city...

By May 2005 I got my “Master of Computer Science” and started working for Adobe Systems in Hamburg. Yes, Adobe got a Hamburg office, something I neither knew before. After some initial QA work, I became software developer quite quickly, and found myself in the XMP metadata team, where we developed a metadata library for all those well-known Adobe products and on three platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux).

Various Development tools, fairly complex Build- and Release-Environments, international Cooperation with Software teams in the U.S. and India... after more than 4½ year with Adobe I may call myself an actual software developer. 2009 was a bad year for the software industry, so also Adobe laid of around 10% of their workforce. Which in retrospective was a good thing. I think I was done with binary filehandler by now (4 bytes forward, 3 bytes back…).

Since 2011 I am a freelance software developer. Initially doing plenty of “typical” agency-style / advertising websites for small and medium-sized online companies in Hamburg. Mostly “full stack” including PHP, Apache, MySQL and the complete frontend (HTML, CSS, jQuery, sprites,…). Frontend was my favourite, also due to my CGI background...

From February 2013 till April 2015 I worked for SPIEGEL Verlag, Germany's well-known news magazine, on numerous projects. Relaunch of subscription sites, converting sites to responsive design, relaunch of an editorial website, self-services and premium configurators...

Currently, since September 2017, I am working on a very nice React.js-Project in Switzerland... my current availabilty can be found in [my XING profile]({{site.profile.xing}}){:target="_blank"}.

I like to do conceptual work and can turn ideas and feature extensions into actual Photoshop pixels quite quickly. My Photography- and CGI-backbround often helps me, to ease communication between product owners and software development.

Durings Hamburgs painfully short summers I like to play Beachvolleyball at the Elbe river, go cycling and kayaking. I still spend some time on panoramic imaging and sports photography.
