**I am a freelance software developer since 2011.** Early on I worked primarily on smaller projects for various Online Agencies in Hamburg. Frequently “full stack“, thus from Frontend (HTML, CSS, javaScript, jQuery, Photoshop) to Backend (PHP, Apache, mySQL).

From 2013 till 2015 I was booked by SPIEGEL Verlag (mayor German news magazine) on a number of projects: Relauch of subscription-shops, marketing and editorial websites, premium configuration modules (complex javaScript). With focus on Frontend, Styling and Responsive Design.

On my most recent projects I primarily worked on React JS Web Apps:
Node JS, npm, gulp, webpack, react-router, redux, ejs, css (less/stylus/sass/jeet), ES6, partially Typescript. As IDEs I use Visual Studio Code and Netbeans unter Linux.

Beside implementation I do like conceptual work and can deliver Photoshop designs and mockups for additional features. In the 90ies I worked a lot on computer graphics and compositing. This “pixelpushing background” often helps me, to reduce overhead between design and coding and clarify tasks directly with stake holders.

In a permanent role I worked nearly 5 years for Adobe Systems and spent another two 2 years at a Polytechnic in Singapore teaching Media Computer Science.
