**I am a freelance web developer** with focus on `react.js` and `UX/UI`. So it's `Javascript`, `ES6`, `NodeJS`, `React` und `Redux`, and styling languages `CSS3`, `Less`, `Sass` und `Stylus`.

When I got self-employed I started working an smaller full-stack projects for various Hamburg media agency. – **„LAMP“** =&nbsp;`Linux`, `Apache`, `MySQL`, `PHP` and `html`, `CSS`&thinsp;&amp;&thinsp;plenty of `jQuery`, naturally.

Then I got a row of projects to work on at the SPIEGEL News Magazine: Responsive Design, Javascript Apps, self-service portals including styling, javascript und connecting templates (JSP, JSTL, EJS, JSX, …) to the respective backends.

With the rise of `NodeJS` all of a sudden JavaScript became a viable option for the backend, alternative to Java or PHP, becoming instantly my backend language of choice.
